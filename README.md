Let's analyze the JavaScript code line by line:

const btnEl = document.getElementById("btn");

This line selects the HTML element with the ID "btn" using the getElementById method of the document object. It assigns the reference to this element to the constant variable btnEl.
const errorMessageEl = document.getElementById("errorMessage");

Here, the HTML element with the ID "errorMessage" is selected and assigned to the constant variable errorMessageEl.
const galleryEl = document.getElementById("gallery");

This line selects the HTML element with the ID "gallery" and assigns it to the constant variable galleryEl.
async function fetchImage() {

This line declares an asynchronous function named fetchImage. Asynchronous functions allow us to perform tasks such as fetching data from an external source without blocking the execution of other scripts.
const inputValue = document.getElementById("input").value;

Here, the value entered into an input field with the ID "input" is retrieved using the getElementById method. It's then assigned to the constant variable inputValue.
if (inputValue > 10 || inputValue < 1) {

This line checks if the inputValue is greater than 10 or less than 1. If true, it indicates that the entered value is invalid.
errorMessageEl.style.display = "block";

If the entered value is invalid, this line sets the CSS display property of the errorMessageEl element to "block", making it visible.
errorMessageEl.innerText = "Number should be between 0 and 11";

This line sets the text content of the errorMessageEl element to inform the user that the entered number should be between 1 and 10.
return;

The function returns early if the entered value is invalid, preventing further execution of the code.
imgs = "";

This line initializes an empty string variable named imgs to store the HTML content of the fetched images.
The remaining code within the try block fetches images from the Unsplash API, updates the gallery with the fetched images, and handles potential errors. Finally, an event listener is added to the button element (btnEl.addEventListener("click", fetchImage);), triggering the fetchImage function when the button is clicked.
